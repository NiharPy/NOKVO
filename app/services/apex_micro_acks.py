"""Deterministic micro-acknowledgments + per-call TTS rendition selection.

Humanization for the APEX deterministic (verbatim) questionnaire path. Two
pure, seeded helpers live here so both the voice stream orchestrator and the
TTS prewarmer import them without cycles:

* ``choose_ack`` — a short, warm, native-script acknowledgment ("సరే.",
  "जी.", "Got it.") spoken before the next verbatim question on ~45% of
  clean advances. The LLM path BANS stock acks because gpt-5-mini repeated
  the same one every turn; this layer is deterministic — seeded per
  call+question, never repeating the previous ack, skipped on the first
  question — so it restores the human answer→ack→question cadence without
  restoring the repetition.

* ``tts_variant_for_call`` — picks which cached rendition (1..N) of a
  scripted line a call speaks. Stable within a call (one "take" per call,
  the way a single human sounds) and spread across calls. crc32, NEVER the
  builtin ``hash()`` (process-salted → workers would disagree).

Both consult ``settings`` at call time so env flips need no restart-order
care, and both are total functions: bad input degrades to "no ack" /
"variant 1", never raises.

# pre-translated into exactly these, and an English "Got it." on a Tamil call
# would be worse than silence.

# "default" is the scripted/legacy pool (pre-styles behavior, byte-identical).
# The style pools (questionnaire_style.CONVERSATION_STYLES) keep the ack
# register congruent with the restyled questions — "Wonderful, thank you."
# between luxury questions, "Awesome, thanks!" between friendly ones. Keep
# each ≤ 4-5 words so the ack stays a beat, not a turn; polite forms always
# (आप-register जी for hi, అండి suffix for te); terminal punctuation (these
# are standalone TTS utterances).
#
# hi/te style-pool lines are DRAFTS pending native-speaker review — sound
# them out with Sarvam before enabling APEX_ACK_ENABLED with styles in prod.
